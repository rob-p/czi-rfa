## Budget 

The budget includes the costs required to complete the proposed work, and
consists of salary support for the PI (>= 1 month) and two graduate students
(12 months each). It also includes costs for AWS compute, extra hard drive
storage for a local server, travel for 2 1-day in person CZI meetings and
open-access publication costs. The full, itemized budget is attached at the
end of this PDF.

## Personnel

- Rob Patro (PI) will commit at least 1 month of dedicated effort to this
 project. He will be responsible for helping to design and develop the
 methods and tools proposed in Aims 1 & 2. He will be responsible for
 mentoring and guiding the junior personnel, evaluating and reporting
 progress on the project, interacting with members of the collaborative
 network, and disseminating research results.

- Avi Srivastava (_tentative_ --- graduate student) will commit 12 months effort to this project.  He will be primarily responsible for helping to design, implement and test the methods proposed in Aim 1.  He will be responsible for helping to analyze the results on both experimental and synthetic data, and will be responsible for integrating these methods into the Salmon/Alevin software.  He will assist in writing the relevant scientific manuscripts and presenting the relevant results at conferences and meetings.

- Hirak Sarkar (_tentative_ --- graduate student) will commit 12 months effort to this project.  He will be primarily responsible for helping to design, implement and test the simulator proposed in Aim 2.  He will be responsible for helping to design the generative models, and to implement them efficiently to allow simulations to produce transcriptome-scale data for thousands of cells.  He will assist in writing the relevant scientific manuscripts and presenting the relevant results at conferences and meetings.


## Materials & Supplies:

We request funds for materials, supplies and other costs which consists of:
- Funds to cover 2 1-day trips to meet with relevant CZI personnel in person and discuss the project
- Funds for AWS compute credits to be used for large-scale processing of scRNA-seq samples with the developed  methods
- Funds for new storage capacity in our local servers to be used for this project
- Funds to cover open-access publication costs for 2 scholarly manuscripts in relevant journals

Specific allocations are included in the budget attached at the end of this PDF.

## Other Support / Funding Overlap:

The following award is _related_ to the work proposed herein, though the nature of this work is complementary and 
not overlapping:

Title: CAREER: A Comprehensive and Lightweight Framework for Transcriptome Analysis \
PI: Rob Patro \
Source of Support: NSF \
Amount: $625,000 \
Award Number: 1750472 \
Period: 02/01/2018 --- 01/01/2023 

Specifically, one of the research aims of this proposal deals with improved methods for cellular barcode correction, as well
as multi-level statistical models for sharing expression information between related cells while processing scRNA-seq data.
These research aims are scheduled along a different timeframe (multiple years), but the complementary methods developed in 
the above-mentioned proposal would help further improve the accuracy of the methods proposed in this work.



# Statement on Sharing / Code and Data Dissemination / Collaboration: 

Our methods and tools will be made available openly as they are designed and developed via our lab's [GitHub organization](https://github.com/COMBINE-lab).  
We will coordinate development of the proposed features and software with CZI engineers, and will communicate design and engineering decisions via 
platforms such as [Slack](http://slack.com) and via GitHub Issues.  We will also welcome pull requests from CZI engineers as well as from other 
members of the community.

The suite of simulated data we generate to benchmark our abundance estimation methods will be documented and made publicly-available for use by other groups.  We will explore multiple options for sharing this data, including [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/) and [FigShare](https://figshare.com/).  Finally, the scholarly papers that result from work will be posted to [bioRxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/) prior to journal submission, and journals with open-access publication options will be targeted.  Any published work deriving from this proposal will cite the appropriate grant number or equivalent.

We commit to share our proposal, methods, code, and research papers openly and under permissive licenses.

# Statement on Human Tissue / Animal Welfare: 

The work proposed herein is purely computational / methodological, and involves neither animal testing nor the collection of human tissue.
